1. Inspect the methods to ensure they are identical.
2. If the methods have different signatures, change the signatures to the one you want to use in the superclass.
3. Create a new method in the superclass, copy the body of one of the methods to it, adjust,
and compile.
4. Delete one subclass method.
5. Compile and test.
6. Keep deleting subclass methods and testing until only the superclass method remains.
7. Take a look at the callers of this method to see whether you can change a required type
to the superclass.
